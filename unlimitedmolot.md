The world isn't run by laws being written on paper - it is running by people. Some's according to law, other's not.    
It depends on each individual how his world will be, how he makes it. He is also need a whole lot of luck.    
It is important to keep a balance in things. Balance is the right word.  
Because the guy that wants too much - risks to loose absolutely everything.  
Ofcourse the guy who want too little from life - might not get anything at all. Â©Thomas Angelo
